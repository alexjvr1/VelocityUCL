# Simulate selection for diploS/HIC

We'll use the demographic history estimated with FSC to simulate a population over time with different levels of selection from standing variation or new mutations. 


Generation time: 1year

Mutation rate: [uniform(2.9 x 10-9, 2.9 x 10-9)] based on estimates from Lep per base per haploid genome per generation. Convert to per locus per generation? 

Recombination rate per locus per generation: exponention [exponential(mean: 0.018375, max: 0.055125)] - from cichlids

Selection coefficients: [uniform(0.01, 0.1)] - from cichlids

Standing vartiation - starting allele frequencies: [loguniform(10−5,10−2)]

New mutations: 

Generate 4000 training sets and 2000 test sets for each catagory and species pair.
