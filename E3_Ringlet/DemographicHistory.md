# Estimate demographic history using FastSimCoal

We have genetic data of Museum and Core populations. I will use FastSimCoal to determine the most likely recent (150yrs) demographic history of A.hyperantus using genome-wide data. 


1. Estimate SFS using ANGSD

2. Set up models to test in FSC

3. Identify the most likely model

4. Estimate the 95% CI around the point estimates
