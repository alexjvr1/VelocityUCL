# PE read merging

After plotting MapDamage profiles, I've found a strange distribution of G>A substitutions in the Ringlet data after merging PE reads. This pattern holds in the Brown Argus and Pararge aegeria museum data as well (run by Frances and Zhirou).

Possible issues: 

1) Adapters haven't been filtered out properly

2) As are kept preferentially over Gs based on base quality during merging. Is there a bias in base quality? Are we more certain of As in general? 

3) Reads are merged before any error correction (e.g. filtering for low quality reads, or removing the first 10bp of the reads. 


## IGV

We can compare the sequences that worked (unmerged PE reads) and the elevated G>A using IGV to view the sequences. 

This can't be launched on the UCL servers, so I'll download the relevant AH-01-1900-02 bam files to my computer:

##Here the reads were merged after mapping, but this isn't seen properly by MapDamage, so MapDamage assess only the inward facing PP reads: 
##WARNING Processed 5090528 paired reads, assumed to be non-overlapping, facing inwards and correctly paired; 4385412 of these were excluded as improperly paired.
#However, this results in the expected substitution frequencies.

So far the only sites that generate believable G>A are the non-overlapping PE reads filtered from the full dataset.
