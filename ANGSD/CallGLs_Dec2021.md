## 1. Subset bam and estimate depth

We're initially working with only one chromosome. We'll subset the bam file to extract only the smallest chromsome. And we'll calculate the depth per sample for these. 

Use the [subset_bam.sh](https://github.com/alexjvr1/VelocityUCL/blob/main/Scripts/susbet_bam.sh) script.
