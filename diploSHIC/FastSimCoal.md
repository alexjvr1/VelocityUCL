# Demographic model of E3 - Ringlet

I'll use FastSimCoal to determine the most likely demographic scenario of core populations (MUS - MODC): 

1) Constant population size

2) Constant expansion

3) Constant decline


## Priors

Time: 100 years

Generations: 1/yr = 100 generations

mutation rate: (Lep) 2.9 x 10-9 per base per haploid genome per generation (Keightly et al. 2014)
