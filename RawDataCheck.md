# Raw Data Check

I identified an issue with E3 MODC with duplicate reads found in the raw fastq files (names, sequence, and quality scores). This accounts for ~23% of the reads (based on one sample tested - AH-01-2017-40). 

Picard Tools MarkDuplicates failed to run on all E3 MODC samples due to the presence of duplicate read names. 

E3 MODC was sequenced in Modern 03 (library name), along with E1_Erebia_epiphron, E2_Erebia_aethiops, H2_Miltochrista_miniata, H3_Eilema_griseola, and I1_Xanthorhoe_fluctuata.
