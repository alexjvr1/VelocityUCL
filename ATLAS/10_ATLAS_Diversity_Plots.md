# Theta estimates from ATLAS


See paper [here](https://www.genetics.org/content/genetics/205/1/317.full.pdf)

We can estimate a global theta, or estimate theta in windows. According to the paper, we can obtain accurate estimates in for data with <1X average depth in windows of 1Mb. 

The [ibis paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982218316099#mmc2) uses 5Mb windows.
