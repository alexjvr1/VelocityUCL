# ROH

Goal: Determine if tracts of identity by descent (IBD) have increased over time 

Approach: Estimate runs of homozygosity (ROH) in the museum and modern populations. 


## Methods

ROH esimated from low ancient DNA if a modern phased reference is available: [Ringbauer et al. 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25289-w)

We need a set of phased modern genotypes. And a minimum of 400000 SNPs for this approach to work.
